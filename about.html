            <h3><b> Voltage and Current Adjustable Power Supply</b></h3>
            <p>The Voltage and Current Adjustable Power Supply circuit provides a stable and adjustable DC output, ideal for various electronic applications. It typically uses a variable voltage regulator like the LM317 or LM338, allowing users to set the output voltage by adjusting external resistors or a potentiometer. The circuit takes an unregulated DC input, smooths it with capacitors, and then regulates the voltage to the desired level. It also features a current-limiting function, protecting connected devices by preventing excessive current flow. This is achieved through a combination of resistors and an operational amplifier that monitors and adjusts the output current. The power supply is essential for lab experiments, prototyping, and powering electronic devices, offering precise control and enhanced safety."</p>
